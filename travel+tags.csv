[Scenic Beauty 1] Hwaam Mineral Spring<br>
At Hwaam Mineral Spring, water rises up through a rock crater located in Dong-myeon, Jeongseon. The water is said to be good for stomachaches, eye infections, and skin diseases; and, as it contains nine essential elements such as calcium and fluorine, it tastes crisp and clean.

With its clean water and wide sheets of rock, Yongmaso Lake is a popular attraction for vacationers. <br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 4] Hwaamdonggul Cave<br>
Hwaamdonggul Cave used to be a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945. The nation’s 5th largest goldmine was, however, found to have natural stalactites, and later the cave was developed as the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 chapters, which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. <br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 5] Hwapyoju Cliff<br>
Hwapyoju is a cliff facing the entrance of Hwapyo-dong, which can be seen on the way from Hwaam-dong to Molundae. The cliff may appear as if a giant sharpened a large sheet of rock and placed it upright, or less imaginatively, as if two pillars are standing side by side. 

<br><br>
[Scenic Beauty 6] Sogeumgang River<br>
The four-kilometer stretch from Hwapyoju to Molundae, surrounded with 100 to 150-meter high rock cliffs and thick forest, is called Sogeumgang River (small Geumgang River), meaning that its beautiful scenery is reminiscent of that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan 
Mountain.<br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 7] Molundae Cliff<br>
Molundae literally means ‘the cliff beyond which clouds disappear’. The tip of the steep cliff is adorned with three specimens of 500-year-old pine trees. Legend has it that gods would perch on the cliff’s top and enjoy the beautiful view. At the foot of the cliff lies a large sheet of rock that can accommodate hundreds of people.

In addition to the war monuments inside the park, there are around a dozen wooden crosses with rusty iron helmets placed on top within the barbed wire entanglements around the hill, thereby reminding visitors of the national tragedy of the Korean War. The county of Hwancheon hosts the Bimok Cultural Festival from June 3 to June 6 every year at Bimok Park, Bungeoseom Island by the town’s riverside, and the surrounding areas. The four-day festival offers a variety of events such as a singing contest, memorial ceremony of poetry reading, bimok tree cutting contest, rice ball eating contest, army life experience, military music parade, and more.

Crossing over to Yanggu County from Peace Dam, there is a national security education place comprised of attractions like the 4th Underground Tunnel and Eulji Observatory. Paroho Lake Battlefield Tourist Park is also worth a visit after looking around Peace Dam. Also known as the “ocean within mountains,” Paroho is a manmade lake created as a result of the Hwacheon Dam construction in 1944. The lake is home to over 70 different species of freshwater fish such as mandarin fish and carp. It also holds the sorrowful history of the water burial of three whole divisions of the Chinese Forces in defending the lake during the Korean War. The name Paroho, meaning “enemy breaking lake,” was given after the late president of Korea, Rhee Syngman, visited the place and designated a plaque in his own handwriting in memory of obtaining victory in fierce battle. There is an observatory, a security hall, and a stone monument engraved with the poetry of Wolha Rhee Taegeuk (1913-2003).",http://tong.visitkorea.or.kr/cms/resource/87/172387_image2_1.jpg,"3481-70, Pyeonghwa-ro, Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon-do",127.8443008498,38.2128865669,"['famous', 'forces', 'fish', 'destination', '70', 'singing', 'history', 'military', 'become', 'result', 'vicinity', 'june', 'defending', 'built', 'visited', 'battle', 'chinese', 'february', 'hall', 'yanggu', 'music', 'hwancheon', 'crosses', 'variety', 'handwriting', 'crossing', 'hill', 'parade', 'worth', '1988', 'dam', 'looking', 'different', 'every', 'dozen', 'control', '”', 'obtaining', 'flooding', 'mandarin', 'divisions', 'origin', 'whole', 'name', 'year', 'observatory', 'victory', 'donated', 'lake', 'helmets', 'tunnel', 'around', 'attack', 'carp', 'education', 'freshwater', 'north', 'funds', 'attractions', '1995', 'county', '3', 'towns', 'ocean', 'construction', 'tree', 'fourday', 'eating', 'security', '4th', 'fierce', '“', 'water', 'life', 'paroho', 'engraved', 'bimok', 'placed', 'flood', 'period', 'army', 'enemy', 'species', '15', 'bungeoseom', 'experience', 'late', 'like', 'manmade', 'war', 'iron', 'may', 'tourist', 'wolha', 'contest', 'peace', 'hosts', 'floods', 'potential', 'cutting', 'poetry', 'given', 'national', 'reading', 'surrounding', 'hwacheon', '1996', 'general', 'geumgangsan', 'response', 'koreas', 'burial', 'monument', 'reminding', 'events', 'years', 'taegeuk', '19132003', 'proved', 'public', 'addition', 'ball', 'known', 'wooden', 'within', 'underground', 'breaking', 'major', 'three', 'rice', 'korean', 'brbr', 'areas', 'president', 'holds', 'rusty', 'wire', 'song', 'top', 'thereby', 'eulji', '6', 'visit', 'monuments', 'riverside', 'home', 'meaning', 'sorrowful', 'mountains', 'tragedy', 'inside', 'plaque', '1987', 'festival', 'designated', 'park', 'cultural', '1999', 'ceremony', 'battlefield', 'months', 'syngman', 'rhee', 'stone', '1944', 'comprised', 'memory', 'memorial', 'created', 'entanglements', 'barbed', 'island']"

430,1112778,76,Mindungsan Mountain (민둥산),"Situated in Jeongseon, Gangwon-do, Mindungsan Mountain (1,118.8 meters) is an unusual site when compared to other national peaks.

Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>

The mountain’s gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>

Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities.

The house is a tangible cultural asset of Gangwon-do Province, and the mulberry tree beside the stone wall is a monument of Gangwon-do Province. It is impressive that the tree is 25m tall and still looks healthy with many branches though it is over 600 years of age. Entering the gate, you can see the Sarangchae house from the front yard. The owners of the house live in the Anchae (the main house) which is beyond the Sarangchae. People can play folk games such as Tuho and Jegichagi in the yard covered with pebbles. The house looks like a small museum with old pieces which had been used by our ancestors in their daily life such as treadmill, wooden rice chest and large wooden bowl displayed in the yard. You can taste coffee and traditional teas in the cafe positioned on one side of the yard. The traditional Ondol rooms are furnished with clean bathrooms to be used conveniently by modern people. However, there is no TV in the room because the owners of Sangyujae consider that it will be better to experience the life of ur ancestors who had lived without a TV and have more conversation with the company who have come together to the house. 
Sangyujae is very close to Jeongseon Arirang Market, just 5 minutes’ walk away, which is the best spectacle in Jeongseon located in Jeongseon-eup. In Jeongseon Arirang Market, you can have a taste of healthy foods in Jeongseon such as Gondeurebap, Kotdeungchigi Noodles, Tadpole Noodles, Buckwheat Crepe and Surichwi Rice Cake.

551,2542529,80,Seongyojang [Korea Quality] / 강릉선교장 [한국관광 품질인증],"
Seongyojang House was built by Yi Nae-beon (pen-name: Mugyeong), an 11th-generation descendant of Grand Prince Hyoryeong (the elder brother of King Sejong the Great), and has been repaired and extended numerous times over the last ten generations. 
The house is composed of a variety of rooms and buildings of different sizes, and there are twelve gates between its many buildings, which include 3 ‘Byeoldang’ rooms (Dong, Seo, and Oe), Sarangchae, Jungsarang, Haengangchae, and Sadang. 
Seongyojang House is well known as one of the largest and greatest houses in Korea in terms of the number and size of its buildings and its total land area among houses built at that time. Interestingly, Seongyojang was built to such a great size due to the influence of the classical poem Gwandongbyeolgok (about the Beautiful Scenery of Gwandong, present-day Gangwon-do, in 1580) written by Jeong Cheol (1536-1593, pen-name: Songgang). Because of the popularity of this poem, a cultural trend emerged in which noblemen of the late Joseon Dynasty felt compelled to visit the Gwandong (present-day Gangwon-do) area at least once in their lifetime, and Seongyojang was a must-see attraction. 
The house experienced a crisis when only three people were staying in this vast building. However, the director of the house, Lee Kang-baek, strived to save his ancestors’ invaluable heritage and finally received the necessary administrative support. Thanks to that, all the toilets and shower facilities were modernized, and Seongyojang House now offers both the beauty of a traditional hanok building and convenient modern facilities for all its guests. 
Seongyojang has many wonderful structures including Hwallaejeong Pavilion, one of its most charming structures; Yeolhwadang, which was given as a gift to the Russian Consulate; Yeonjidang, which was built in an elegant style; and Seobyeoldang. In particular, the signboard of Hwallaejeong was changed and rewritten regularly by members of the Joseon literati who stayed in the house. The most famous version of the signboard was written by Gim Jeong-hui (1786-1856, pen-name: Chusa).

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain’s famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Erman's birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek – Seorak Falls – Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.

Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san).
